# practice_website

# This website is designed so that I can refine my HTML and CSS skills. I am self-taught, having introduced myself to HTML and CSS in December 2017. If you notice anything wrong in the code, please feel free to add to it, just add a comment so that I can learn. You can also add any pointers, tips, or tricks in here as well. Thanks!
